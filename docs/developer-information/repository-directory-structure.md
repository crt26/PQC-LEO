# Repository Directory Structure - fix and update directory listing

## Overview
This document outlines the directory structure of the `PQC-Evaluation-Tools` repository. It includes both the default contents available upon cloning and the directories that are dynamically generated during operation. 

Directories created by scripts during execution are marked with an asterisk (`*`) in the directory layout diagram.

## Layout and Descriptions
The `PQC-Evaluation-Tools` repository directories are organised as follows:

```
